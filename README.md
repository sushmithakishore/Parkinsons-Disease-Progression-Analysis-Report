# 📊 Parkinson’s Disease Progression Analysis Report

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analytical report on the progression of Parkinson’s Disease using structured clinical data. The report integrates statistical analysis, longitudinal modeling, and interactive visualization to examine disease severity, treatment impact, and progression trends over time.

Using Python for statistical modeling and Tableau for dashboard visualization, the study transforms raw clinical datasets into interpretable insights that support evidence-based understanding of disease dynamics.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Baseline Clinical Assessment
- Demographic and disease duration analysis  
- UPDRS I–IV score evaluation  
- Hoehn & Yahr stage classification  
- Cognitive and functional metric assessment (MMSE, ADL, TUG, PDQ-39, GDS)  
- Correlation heatmap analysis  

### 2️⃣ Progression Analysis
- Variable distribution comparison across disease stages  
- Time-series tracking of UPDRS Part III scores  
- Longitudinal patient-level trend analysis  
- Feature relationship and importance evaluation  

### 3️⃣ Statistical Evaluation
